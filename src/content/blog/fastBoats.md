<h2>fast boat, slow shore</h2>

<h2>they said you gotta be sure</h2>

<h2>concrete, quick pour</h2>

<p>I'm not sure if I know me anymore</p>

<p>And one day it becomes true</p>

<p>You think you got em then they're loose</p>

<p>talk enough</p>

<p>but not too much</p>

<p>I think I'm ok, you're ok</p>

<h2>fast boat, slow shore</h2>

<h2>they said you gotta be sure</h2>

<h2>concrete, quick pour</h2>

<p>I'm not sure if I know me anymore</p>

<p>sticky fingers have no fears</p>
<p>whip it up, and it serves for years</p>

<p>slow down let's hope it's enough</p>

<p>I think I'm ok, you're ok</p>
